## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event in December that features daily coding puzzles. Each day from December 1st to December 25th, a new programming challenge is released. These challenges are a great way to improve problem-solving skills and learn new algorithms and data structures.

You can find more about Advent of Code [here](https://adventofcode.com/).
